🧑‍💻 Hey, I’m Usman — part-time tutor, full-time overthinker of algorithms

Currently studying Computer Science at King’s College London (yes, the one with the fancy library and slightly-too-steep stairs). I build things that (mostly) work, break things to learn how they tick, and occasionally make websites that don’t look like they’re from 2003.

🔧 What I’ve Built (and Why You Should Care)

► Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Rust + Piston)
Watch bubbles sort themselves while you sip tea. Built this to see why O(n log n) is cooler than it sounds. Also, Rust doesn’t forgive mistakes — which means I’ve learned to cry less and debug more.

► Task Manager API (Go + Kubernetes)
Because remembering deadlines is hard. Made it scream-fast with goroutines, then threw it into Kubernetes just to see if I could. Spoiler: I could. It scales. Like, emotionally and technically.

► Python Aim Trainer
Turns out, coding and FPS games have something in common — precision. Built this to track my click accuracy (yes, really), graph my progress, and export data so I can flex on my friends. Data > ego.

► Lambda Tuition Website (HTML/CSS/JS/Tailwind/Vite)
Taught myself front-end by building a site for my tutoring biz. SEO’d it so hard, Google started saying “good morning” to me. Grew client base by 120% — turns out parents really like websites that load fast.
